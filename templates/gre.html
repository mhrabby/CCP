            <p>The GRE or Graduate Record Examinations is the SAT for graduate level university
admissions. The GRE is a standardized aptitude test designed to test studentsâ€™
capabilities and is widely accepted all over the world. However, unlike the SAT,
the GRE has universal recognition and is applicable for Canadian and Australian
universities along with other countries.

The GRE is accepted for business school programs, MBA programs and doctoral
programs in business.</p>
